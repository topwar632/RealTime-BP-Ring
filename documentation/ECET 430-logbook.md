**LOGBOOK**

* Initially I was figuring out how to have a proper logbook that works with git.  
* I had started with word doc but I wasnâ€™t too sure how to have my comments. The issue I faced was no edits were uploaded to the git. The only thing that was updated on the document was the document title.   
* This current edit was done through terminal.
